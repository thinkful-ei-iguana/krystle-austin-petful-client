### How it works

The adoption process works strictly on a "First-In, First-Out" basis. The FIFO is based on the animals that came to the shelter first. People can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but they may only adopt the animal that came to the shelter first is the one to be adopted first. In addition, people who wants to adopt are also put in a Queue so they can adopt when its their turn.
